## Enumeration

Enumeration (information gathering) = collecting as much data about the target as possible:
- Infrastructure
- Assets
- Personnel

Can be completed either:
- **Actively**: Directly probing the services in scope for information or;
- **Passively**: Enumeration without directly interacting with the services
- Tradeoff between enumeration efficacy vs secrecy
