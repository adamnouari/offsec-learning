# Scoping


## What is Scoping?

Defines what actions are allowed to be carried out against which services. E.g.
- IP addresses/ranges
- Hosts
- Applications
- Network devices
- Allowed/disallowed attack vectors (think DDoS)
- Timing/location/other constraints of testing


## Pentesting Methodology Overview

At a high level, pentesting follows a structure similar to the following presented below, but in practice it is a bit more complicated and not so rigid or linear:
1. Scoping
2. Information Gathering
3. Vulnerability Detection
4. Initial Foothold
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Lateral Movement
7. Reporting/Analysis
8. Remediation
